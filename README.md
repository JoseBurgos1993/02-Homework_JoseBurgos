#02-Homework_JoseBurgos

For this assignment, I created 3 pages for my portfolio: a home page with an 'about me', a portfolio page
that i will one day fill links to my work (for now its only placeholder images), and a contact page.

My about-me contains a short bio, a photo of myself, and links to my github and linkedin.

At first, the header two elements, my name and the navbar, are on the same row. Once the screen gets small enough,
they will switch to using two rows. The images on my the about-me and the portfolio do shrink, although it's not
super obvious. The shrinking only really happens once the screen gets small, and by that point I can't actually make
the screen any smaller to really see how it looks. I've tested on mobile and it looks fine.
